has been pecked by zombie birds general morton is in charge of the situation has to stop the zombie plague from spread throughout the whole world but will he his men succeed this italian produced film was to be directed by italian zombie gore film auteur lucio fulci but the story goes he suffered stroke therefore couldnt finish the film so producer franco gaudenzi asked second unit director bruno mattei writer claudio fragasso to step in complete the film apparently mattei fragasso did more than just finish it they actually disregarded lot of the footage fulci shot added lot of their own zombi ended up as nearly straight split the script by fragasso is an absolute mess none of it is well thought out is just as stupid as it gets the scenes of zombie birds attacking people are not only technically inept but the whole idea is just absurd the zombies themselves have no consistency whatsoever look at the scene where patricia is on the bridge the zombies are slow as they shuffle along but then look at the scene earlier on where she was attacked by the zombie with the machete because that one runs around like its on steroids then for no reasonable explanation about minutes before the film finishes the zombies suddenly develop the ability to speak which also looks daft there are so many things wrong with zombi scene after scene of terribly thought out ineptly directed action awful characters really dull broken english dialogue which doesnt make sense half the time then theres the embarrassing scene where the zombie head inside the fridge suddenly develops the ability to fly through the air bite someones neck the scene when the guys in white contamination suits at the end are about to kill kenny roger but instead of using their automatic rifles they decide to try kill them by hand even when kenny picks up gun himself they still refuse to use their rifles when kenny starts to shoot them all they still refuse to use their rifles its one of the most ineptly handled scenes ever put to film then theres the end where kenny takes off in the helicopter but cant rest it down on the ground for literally few seconds to pick his buddy up then load of zombies suddenly spring up from under some piles of grass what since when did zombies hide themselves yet alone under piles of grass this all may sound fun but believe me its not its really bad film that is just boring repetitive simply doesnt work on any level as piece of entertainment except for few unintentional laughs its hard to know who was responsible for what exactly but none of the footage is particularly well shot it has bland lifeless feel about it for some reason the makers have tried to bath every scene in mist the problem is they clearly only had one fog machine you can see that at one corner of the screen the mist is noticeably thicker as it is coming straight out of the machine thinning out as it disperses across the scene since lot of it is set during the day it doesnt add any sort of atmosphere whatsoever when they do get it right the mist is evenly spread across the screen it just looks like they shot the scene on foggy day the direction is poor with no consistency it just looks feels bottom of the barrel stuff even the blood gore isnt up to much theres gory hand severing at the start scene when something rips out of pregnant womans stomach legless woman what actually took her legs off in the pool by the way why didnt it take the legs off the guy who jumped in to save her few ok looking zombies is as gory as it gets for anyone hoping to see gore fest the likes of which fulci regularly served up during the late early will be very disappointed there arent any decent feeding scenes no intestines no stand out head shots very little gore at all technically the film is poor the special effects are cheap looking the cinematography is dull the music is terrible the locations are bland it has rock bottom production values this was actually shot in the philippines to keep the cost down to minimum the entire film is obviously dubbed the acting still looks awful though the english version seems to have been written by someone who doesnt understand the language that well zombi is not sequel to fulcis classic zombie gore fest zombi it has nothing to do with it at all apart from the cash in title im sorry but zombi is an amateurish mess of film its boring it makes no sense its not funny enough to be entertaining it lacks any decent gore one to avoid',\n",

the story already he has compiled four books of short story collections ve read them all from nightshift to the latest everything eventual and they all display an efficiency of getting to the point which is sometimes sorely lacking in his tome sized novels but his short stories never overstay their welcome which brings us to the tv adaptations of nightmares and dreamscapes how in the hell did they the series producers get green light to turn stories that usually averaged pages into minute episodes ll tell you how two words stephen king stories with his name on them probably didn come cheap and one hour shows enable more advertising than half hour ones so what should have been an anthology of mostly or minute episodes is turned into double that length and double the commercial time ka ching not going to waste time synopsizing the plots of these stories this review supposes you have already read the stories and or seen the show what follows is merely my gut reactions to what tnt presented of the four installments so far here my ten cent assessment from first to worst battleground not classic by any means but hey how could anyone argue with keeping william hurt from opening his trap by filming this episode without single line of dialog and the tongue in cheek reference and destruction of the killer zuni doll from trilogy of terror proved to me the producers and the writer of the teleplay who is richard matheson son the writer of tot knew their mission with this one was to make the action deadly yet at the same time fun it took longer to get to hurt apartment than it should have but think it fulfilled it objective umney last case liked this one primarily because of william macy performance think the writer umney should have appeared in the story sooner into the private eye umney beginning because he was the actual reality of the story and anyone familiar with the king short story probably half if not more of the audience knew the chandleresque set up was due to get interrupted by the writer reality so let get on with it already and cut out the cute and clever hard boiled repartee private dick banter already once the writer umney family tragedy began to reveal though thought the show developed an emotional connection that made the viewer me at least feel sympathy for the real life macy attempt to escape his sorrows by usurping his fictional creation exciting life the end of the whole mess uh this title is how felt about this episode when it was over after twenty minutes was ready to scream at the tv ok we get it already the younger brother is mega mensa genius prodigy extraordinaire we know from ron livingston talking to the camera time is running out for me not fast enough thought that the young whiz kid is going to discover something really bad for humanity we know this because he already built an airplane but almost died because he couldn steer it out of the path of tree and he blew up his chemistry lab while teaching himself chemistry to think the end of the world could have been prevented if only this kid had some more parental supervision so much time was wasted on establishing the uber genius of henry thomas when we finally get to the resolution of his discovery the end of the world through unintended idiocy how much do we get to see of the world ending cheap video shot of reporter starting to forget what she reporting on and brief radio broadcasts announcing the day of judgement is at hand oh and the brother parents drooling and singing old songs my point is if your story is really about the end of the whole mess world wanna see the mess as it goes up in flames and crashes and burns talk about ending with whimper indeed crouch end this episode just ticked me off totally could have lived with the taking forever exposition of the happy couple arriving at their hotel playing slap and tickle having lunch and getting taxi that was half the episode right there if once they finally crossed over into crouch end the episode delivered the chills but it failed miserabley not only wasn it scary it was practically laughable ooh look kitty wait it turns oh my god look at it scary eye uh huh they could have gone long way towards filming the crouch end sequence at night instead of in daylight too things you might unintentionally find funny can become scarier when you see them in the night shadows but guess the budget wasn high enough to shoot at night on the fake london sets they slapped together for this one on the page this is very scary story about tourists wandering into places they shouldn

       " 'myra breckinridge is one of those rare films that established its place in film history immediately praise for the film was absolutely nonexistent even from the people involved in making it this film was loathed from day one while every now and then one will come across some maverick who will praise the film on philosophical grounds aggressive feminism or the courage to tackle the issue of transgenderism the film has not developed cult following like some notorious flops do it not hailed as misunderstood masterpiece like scarface or trotted out to be ridiculed as camp classic like showgirls undoubtedly the reason is that the film though outrageously awful is not lovable or even likable myra breckinridge is just plain mean as hollywood satire it is cold blooded and mean spirited but in hollow pointless way myra takes for granted that hollywood is corrupt town but goes further to attack such beloved icons as laurel and hardy shirley temple judy garland and gary cooper the film seems to imply that everything about hollywood is by its very nature vile it seems to think that there is something inherently courageous about mocking sacred cows but doesn supply rationale for doing the mocking in the first place the film is also viscously anti american and anti establishment and anti this and anti that but all in superficial late trendy way like casino royale ski doo love you alice toklas and other would be hip epics myra is middle aged vision of the hippy dippy youth culture it tries to embrace the very attitude that it belittles but instead of being cheerfully self mocking myra makes no attempt to conceal its contempt for everything that comes within its grasp myra breckinridge has the humor of bully there not single moment of innocence in it its intentions aren honorable time magazine aptly described it as being about as funny as child molester but it not nearly as sympathetic for instance poor mae west bore the brunt of so much of the criticism aimed at the film being described as looking like everything from an aging drag queen to reanimated walking corpse the octogenarian star obviously didn know just how ridiculous she looked playing lecherous talent agent lusting after men young enough to be her grandsons or even her great grandsons but director michael sarne had to know but he used her anyway why because she apparently was the joke just like john huston john carradine grady sutton andy devine and other veteran performers in the film they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images they are cast as smarmy self parodies as is rex reed the arrogant fey film critic who is cast as just that in the film but the real reed the celebrity hound jet setting talk show gossip can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way but as myron myra alter ego he is just obnoxious again apparently for sarne reed is the joke you watch myra breckinridge and you don see actors you see victims none more so than raquel welch no one will ever accuse welch of being great actress but it is testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered being in almost every scene welch was front and center as target for abuse aimed at the film but to her credit she gives remarkably nuanced performance though of course centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west welch doesn have to do much to strike good balance even so she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with deadpan smirk with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud legend has it that welch was snubbed by condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such cool and collected performance the film only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film agenda is the whole story is fantasy fable which should indicate that it has moral to deliver but what that might be is anybody guess with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race it would seem to have feminist axe to grind but as feminist myra is monstrous figure sexual predator besides myra isn woman rather she is delusion of myron who presumably is gay male that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character love hate attitude toward the macho seemingly straight deadhead rusty but it doesn explain his her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcett mary ann the film is obsessed with sex but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution all the sex is treated as being if not dirty than at least perverse and degrading turning to gore vidal original novel isn of any help because it is as confused and pointless as the movie and this is rare movie that actually seems to hate movies not just movies as business but movies as part of the culture as well the film itself is wall to wall arcane references to old movies all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with seething disdain he has raided the film vaults of th century fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films not as an homage or to provide social commentary but to mock the innocence of old hollywood how can an artist if you generously want to call sarne that make work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in the very effort is totally self defeating myra breckinridge doesn seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty it hates hollywood it hates america it hates sex it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and well you name it and it probably has scene showing contempt for it in very sad and sorry way myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto celebration of pop culture

       " 'around the late animator don bluth frustrated with the output his company disney was churning defected from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of nimh was brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were commercially successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of nimh they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don bluth had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney the little mermaid considering that the movie has such friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead bluth provides surprisingly dark story involving gambling deceit crime mistreatment and murder that itself is not problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it movie with major identity crisis set in dreary junkyard of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie barkin rough and tumble german shepherd is run over by car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner nasty cigar puffing pitbull carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by default here whippet angel annabelle tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the whippet aside are presented as anything but upon realizing that he been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his dachshund pal itchy charlie rescues carface prize annemarie human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little cutie find her family but in reality he is using her skills to win fortunes at the race so that he can build more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love annemarie the concept of the story isn as problematic as the execution aside from the human girl annemarie and flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through with the vocal pipes of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too unlovable as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further damaging to the character is the disappointingly uncharismatic vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie running time the aforementioned musical alligator who resides in danky sewer infested with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does scene where charlie tries to show his generosity to annemarie by feeding pack of pastel colored pups pizza the whole screenplay feels like rough first draft bit more polish could have made this tighter impactful story matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie strouse and kuenster annemarie song and the gator ballad are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken page mellifluous vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt reynolds stiff and lifeless charlie detracts from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom deluise as itchy is pretty good but he had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of nimh ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such small part that his overall contribution is unremarkable at best similarly wasted are loni anderson as collie who once sired litter with charlie melba moore and charles nelson reilly judith barsi as annemarie is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole legitimately likable one in this depressing and joyless show barsi aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from bluth team by standards that is particularly frightening scene where charlie has nightmare about ending up in fiery underworld ruled by gargantuan satanic canine demon if anything the movie is more of triumph of animation than storytelling on the whole however cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does admittingly provide some energy and moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as bluth better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave bad taste in your mouth',\n",

       " 'figured that its about time let this one out pok mon fans are suffering in america these days why because we rely on kids wb and kids entertainment to provide us with our beloved series and movies as far as the series goes they do pretty good job in bringing the fun and magic of the japanese versions to television so what is their problem when it comes to the movies honestly now have seen all three pok mon movies in japanese and will definitely be seeing the fourth one they are excellent movies they are all enjoyable and fun to watch and after seeing pok mon in theaters cant help but wonder how these american producers read the japanese scripts the way it appears it seems that they read and see something that says insert empty moral here in big bold faced letters it definitely appears that way as they used the same wonderful dubbing methods they used on msb extreme sarcasm there and created this crap possible spoilers from here on well guess should first talk about pikachus rescue adventure my first gripe with this came with no narration guess they got enough bad comments on the pok dex narration that plagued pikachus vacation and instead of going with caring gentle womans voice as appeared in pikachu no natsu yasumi and pikachu tankentai they just cut the narration all together this wouldnt have been problem except for one thing did anyone really understand why the exeggcute didnt let togepi go until the end possibly the fans but im sure not the parents then theres the theme song couldnt help but roll my eyes at this one the japanese theme song was tankentai wo tsukurou and was sung by japanese children it was fun and enjoyable this one nauseating now one of my favorite parts of the short was the dancing kireihana nice music fun to watch thats changed with the bellossom the music sucked for one but on top of that they had all the pok mon talk during the music which turned out to be jumpy annoying and just unnecessary oh and then theres the poliwhirl who thinks hes poliwrath youd think that guys that work with these characters constantly would at least learn what they are basically not much could save this little ill fated dub which is very unfortunate considering its potential but havent touched on the worst of it yet youd think that the warning signs wouldve been apparent to me when received my issue of nintendo power for some unfathomable reason had been placing some faith in kids and the wb my thoughts were well they screwed up on the first movie but the second is different as far as the theme goes so they should do well that in mind just didnt pay attention to the warning signs encountered in the theaters when the trailers said you will believe that one person can make all the difference with the way they said that at every turn was hoping that this would not turn into moral fest like msb did at the end of the english version then comes nintendo power in which see all my fears realized in the words the main feature the power of one at that point became bit more uneasy the power of one not good sign however still kept some of my false faith big mistake sitting in the theater was literally getting stomach cramps watching another movie which loved in japanese being turned into complete and utter junk hear comments that say it was better because the moral was more subtle can see point in that since they didnt pander this thing repeating it over and over like in msb however it did more damage than anything else in this movie first of all the legend that was read throughout was changed bit to read the world turns to ash ah hah so ash is the chosen one whatever in the japanese version the inhabitants of arshia needed pok mon trainer to carry out their traditional ceremony this time hes the chosen one greater way that this did damage was to lugia lugia was one of the coolest characters in pok mon movie when the movie was about lugia in this one lugia is forced to take back seat to ash in the scene where theyre flying back to the main island lugia and ash are discussing the conditions of lugias existence not that ash is going to make all the difference overall in this category ash wasnt really the one person that would make the difference since he was helped by many along the way lot of the other stuff is kind of nit picking fururas flute song wasnt nearly as sweet and enjoyable as the japanese one jirarudans speech to them saying his collection started with mew card ugh even worse mistys outrage originally concerned the way moltres and zapdos were being held why didnt you put them in pok balls when you caught them this is like caging them to be displayed much different from whining about him thinking pok mon are things to be collected like stamps if there were any real redeeming values in this they came from team rocket some pretty funny lines not really to make me laugh out loud but more to make me giggle and slightly ease the pains in my stomach well that was officially the last american pok mon movie im going to see ive imported the third one and find it very enjoyable would rather not see another japanese movie be ruined in the same fashion as the first two ill be importing the fourth one as well forget you kids wb and kids you have forsaken me for the last time',\n",

       " 'where to begin how about with the erroneous synopsis men origins wolverine tells the story of wolverine epically violent and romantic past his complex relationship with victor creed and the ominous weapon program his epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non violent his relationship with creed is so glossed over it difficult to understand how they have any connection at all we are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run to montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan and finally to the present where they are part of hardcore government team of assassins there is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving the romantic element of the movie between silverfox and wolverine was forced and abrupt we are thrown into romance so fast that it over before you can blink an eye having just introduced the character silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later we are left wondering why we should care about this who was she anyway for pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story the romance is surprisingly unexplored it was rushed in simply because it was required oddly enough when wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find sabertooth being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off very predictable surprise as for the weapon program lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure wolverine is up and running eventually he arrives at the home of conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple surprisingly ma and pa kent aren alarmed when finding naked sweaty man in their barn is it any wonder what fate awaits them in the previous films and the comic books the main reason that wolverines amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded knowing this was the case did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates as hinted to in men united when stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together this film sets up the team fairly well only they don really do much of anything no disturbing violence no ruthless actions they merely harass few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen it seems that wolverine wasn an evil man under stryker at all instead he was constantly trying to put leash on his brother sabertooth which consequently was the violent agent we all thought wolverine was eventually he just leaves all together no conflict of duality here at all idiotically removing that character conflict of good and evil dulled the story immensely they may as well have given him rubber claws there were ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the men trilogy including the introduction of one of the lamest deus ex machinas to ever hit script magic memory erasing bullets really apparently they are the only thing to bring down wolverine yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on wolverine while throwing in ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story most were in the film for minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of wolverine fred dukes the blob but not the comic version can punch launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all but simple headbutt from wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him cyclops optic beams which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers can burn through buildings but when fired at sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes adamantium trench coats anyone the gravity defying mutant gambit instead of utilizing his signature cards is made into some sort of crazy acrobat in one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by wolverine then amazingly enough few minutes later he is on rooftop running towards wolverine how he regained consciousness ran away few blocks climbed up building then ran back to wolverine and sabertooth in the middle of scratching match is mystery yet to be explained some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash the idea that this movie being comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect the comic book source material the real origin of wolverine is story worth bringing to the screen it doesn sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless cgi junkies it is well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time began with weapon by barry windsor smith much more intense and exciting story this fox film should seriously be forgotten anyone have that magic gun',\n",

       " 'someone some day should do study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions searches for secret passageways and crypts trackings of monsters through air ducts and so forth offhand can recall only few films in which architecture played major role throughout demon seed cube the remake of thirteen ghosts but it at the heart of every story about spooky house or church or crypt it all about the character and the affect of spaces passages and walls so was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central the idea is this an architect has built actually rebuilt for himself huge and rambling house his wife has just left him mainly because of his own self centeredness but also it is intimated because she can get used to the place since he remodeled it living in unaccustomed solitude real this time rather than virtual he comes to suspect that somebody else stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees him this is good start for melodrama whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder few times without success the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches trying in various ways to surprise intercept or ambush the intruder maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn foresee or doesn remember the movie would turn into cat and mouse game hunt battle and finally in trying to trap the intruder the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation in some way he didn expect then he would be forced to think himself out of it and maybe at the same time out of his own self imposed isolation and in final twist would nail and maybe even kill the er nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just house the architect is just guy and his nemesis is of an unknown character if he exists at all here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the house if he is the architect begins hearing noises but when he goes to investigate finds nothing he calls the police they think he slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night she thinks he more nuts at last more or less accidentally he runs into the intruder doesn get good look but figures who else could it be not hard question in story with to that point fewer than three principal characters whereupon he locks the doors lowers the grills on the windows throws away the key don know why he thought this necessary and leaves his victim to starve missed why this was given the doors and walls are made of steel in any event the architect takes to sleeping in his car and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further something else must be devised to take its place and this is it the architect are you ready moves into the house of the man who presumably moved into his and lives there in the same way how is this possible it is not but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible what ensues plunges right in the architect takes up residence with martin wheelchair ridden wife unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he able always to leave room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around throughout this section the movie is clever in one way making or leaving it to the viewer to make the point that his life with this stranger who doesn know he there is in essence the same life he lived with his wife as virtual recluse with her as convenient buffer but at the same time his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat burglar entirely incredible not to go into the series of twists at the end including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door this one in front of landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and before the story started the unnoticed construction of tunnel under several houses to the final long anticipated twist the movie adds another to make it even more offensive and then ends here is story that depends on the development of two things the idea of the stranger in the house and the character of the man whose house it is and fumbles both the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry as it pushed its main character farther and farther along more and more zigzaggy path and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel builder and sneak tenant the story should be redone by someone some day',\n",

       " 'after watching some of hbo great stuff band of brothers rome etc must say had pretty high expectations before watching the first episode of true blood jeez often the script seemed to be written by an year old some parts are just horribly filmed the scene in which she saves bill mean come on she throws chain at the guy and ow it goes around his neck and it magically chokes him that was pretty embarrassing if you want my opinion or few moments before that scene when she finds out that the couple is gone with bill ridiculous she hears them plan their stuff and like seconds later magic the of them are gone and without any struggle or noise or anything mean the idea of the show seemed interesting mysterious intriguing vampires co existing with human in our modern society but honestly don think they really wanted to make more of this than petty soap show that the average teen girl watches all the time but that nobody else cares about unfortunately the script is written poorly mediocre at best it shallow and extremely predictable often thought that this was some kind of joke or something the actors deliver really unconvincing performances if you want my opinion they seem to take the show very lightly as if it were some kind of regular low budget family tv show well maybe thats what it is if you take away the family part the only actor that seemed somewhat good to me was stephen moyer in the role of bill considering the poorly written extremely short replies he had to say what are you can give you call sometime think he did good in bringing out the somewhat mysteriously scary part of vampire that anyone with vampire role must have actually anna paquin was okay as well but not more but the guy playing her brother though jeez he horrible the scene in which he gets arrested is just simply shame to modern television the acting is bad the construction site looks fake to the bone and the two other guys why is he getting arrested uh dunno that was pretty embarrassing another thing that think was completely missed was the way they presented sookie psychic powers they make us hear what people think and speak both at the same time and thats just wrong often it just seems unnecessarily chaotic as if people thought were some sort of an annoying radio channel and that when she comes close to em she hits the right frequency level and has to hear everything that they think and finally the sex scenes are just plainly unnecessary and that vampire sex tape thing was just totally disgusting don get me wrong wrote all these comments not because thought the show was bad but because was very disappointed expected quality stuff didn think it was going to be like that it definitely not good show though mediocre at best',\n",
